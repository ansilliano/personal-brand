              There are those who say that we must find our passion but with so
              many options in life, how to choose just one?.
            </p>
            <p>
              I consider myself a curious, creative person and always with the
              active <span>desire to learn</span> new things. That is why in my
              life I like to constantly experiment in different fields
              (personal, professional, academic, etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to create this space to share those experiments that
              Iâ€™ve enjoyed in life and that have helped me to be the{' '}
              <span>Angela</span> that I am today.
