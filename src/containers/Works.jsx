            <p>
              Most of my experience is linked to the area of{' '}
              <span>architecture</span>, however, Iâ€™ve done freelance work
              related more to graphic design, branding, and UX/UI design.

              Since I began to educate myself and become more involved with the
              tech world, I could immediately realize that this is where I want
              to be due to its <strong>exponential growth</strong>. I
              don&lsquo;t know what the future will hold but I do know that with
              the best disposition on my part and thirst for knowledge, it is an
              industry in which you never stop growing..
