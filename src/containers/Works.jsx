            <p>
              Most of my experience is linked to the area of architecture,
              however, Iâ€™ve done freelance work related more to graphic design,
              branding, and UX/UI design.

              Since I began to educate myself and become more involved with the
              tech world, I could immediately realize that this is where I want
              to be due to its exponential growth. I don&lsquo;t know what the
              future will hold but I do know that with the best disposition on
              my part and thirst for knowledge, it is an industry in which you
              never stop growing..
